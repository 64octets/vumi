===================================
Writing your first Vumi app, part 1
===================================

This is the first part in a series of tutorials demonstrating how to develop Vumi apps.

In this tutorial we'll be developing a simple chat bot with which you can communicate via XMPP (in particular Google Talk).

We'll assume you have a working knowledge of `Python <https://python.org/>`_ and `VirtualEnv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_

.. admonition:: Where to get help:

    If you're having trouble at any point feel free to drop by 
    `#vumi on irc.freenode.net`__ to chat with other Vumi users 
    who might be able to help.
